### Description

- Users can enter keyboard input (letters).

- Each of the car's methods are assigned to a key.

- When the user presses a key, it calls the appropriate function.

- These letters also trigger a global function called `reWriteStats()` that logs the car's make, model, color, mileage, and `isWorking` status to the console.
